[Download the file above](https://directme.ga/?!MAsFwa4b!d8o1uz6SffMAATSQmERLIYITkyc-eTbKQ6xqI3IQSms) or [watch it](https://directme.ga/view?!MAsFwa4b!d8o1uz6SffMAATSQmERLIYITkyc-eTbKQ6xqI3IQSms) ([original link](https://mega.nz/#!MAsFwa4b!d8o1uz6SffMAATSQmERLIYITkyc-eTbKQ6xqI3IQSms)).

## How to use:

When downloading a file replace `https://mega.nz` with `https://directme.ga`.
 *Everything works in your computer* and you can download anything directly from MEGA.

You can view files, if your browser supports then, by using `view` before the `#` part.
Folders are also supported: a link to a folder will show a list the files inside it so you can download or view one of those.

## Warning:

This website **don't** bypass any bandwidth quota.  
But you can use the splitter to workaround that: https://directme.ga/splitter

## FAQ:

* **Q:** Why downloading don't work?  
**A:** If it's not download then there's a bug: clear your browser cache.  
If it still don't works open an issue (or find other way to contact the developers).
* **Q:** Where is the direct link?  
**A:** To get a direct link, use the method to download shown above, but in the link change the '#' to a '?'. E.g. https://mega.nz/#!MAsFwa4b!d8o1uz6SffMAATSQmERLIYITkyc-eTbKQ6xqI3IQSms => https://directme.ga/?!MAsFwa4b!d8o1uz6SffMAATSQmERLIYITkyc-eTbKQ6xqI3IQSms
* **Q:** Can I use it in some download manager?  
**A:** It works using JavaScript, so no. If you open it in any download manager it will only download an HTML page and nothing else.
* **Q:** How it works?  
**A:** Downloading like the image shows uses Service Workers and Streams API.
Currently only [Google Chrome / Chromium](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4531143755956224) supports that.
In other browsers it uses `Blob` and `a[download]` (similar to MEGA).
